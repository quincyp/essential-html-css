INFO 343 Essential HTML/CSS Challenge Assets
Note:

Hi Zach,

I hope this isn't too different or anything, but I added in some changes from the direct instructions.
I think these changes reflect the images better than the instructions
(or rather I think may have been missing from the instructions? such as italics for the footer, or the up arrow etc.)

Also the "previous challenge" link is broken on this assignment and am just assuming this README note is preferred.

Best,
Quincy
